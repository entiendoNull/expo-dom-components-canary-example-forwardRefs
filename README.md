# Experimental DOM Components with Expo Canary

Based on this repo: https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-dom-components-canary-example

This is just a small, requested repro of how forwardRefs doesn't seem to work as intended when "use dom" is applied in a component.
Instead they are applied to the WebView.

The "Reality"-tab has a DOM component in the part with a red border.
